            <strong>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.</strong> It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined

          Since it is the fourth brightest object in the sky, Jupiter was observed since ancient times and thus no one can be credited for its discovery. <strong>However, the first telescopic observations were conducted by <em>Galileo Galilei</em> in 1609 and in 1610 Galileo also discovered the major moons of Jupiter, but of course not the smaller ones.</strong>

          Since many cultures observed Jupiter, they all gave it different names but the Roman name remained used in the majority of cultures. Jupiter is named after the principal Roman god, the equivalent of the Greek god Zeus.
